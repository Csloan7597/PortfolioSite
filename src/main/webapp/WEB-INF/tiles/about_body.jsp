<h1>About Me</h1>

<div class = "section"> 
<p>I'm Conor Sloan, a recently graduated Software Development Engineer for the 
<a href="http://www.bookdepository.com">Book Depository</a>, an 
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">Amazon</a> company.<br><br> 
I was born in Wallasey, Merseyside on the 24th January 1992, and grew up in various 
locations including Surrey and Munster, Germany. <br><br>

I have relatively broad skills and interests, including Software Development, Testing and good 
Engineering practices. Having attended two placements during an industrial year, I have experience 
in a professional environment working with a range of hardware and software technologies.
My interests lie mainly with Cloud Computing, Web Services & Virtualisation, and I aim to build a 
career working with these exciting and increasingly important technologies.</p>
